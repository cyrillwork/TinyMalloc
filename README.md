TinyMalloc library - simple memory manager. The library implements redefining dynamic memory functions, save statistics in file for checking out memory leaks and defragment. Works only with gcc. For examples see directory test.
Simple description. Overrides the functions for working with dynamic memory: malloc, free, realloc, calloc. When starting, a large block of memory is allocated, then when running, if a block of memory larger than the specified size is requested, the address from the initial block of memory is returned, if smaller, the standard melloc, free,... functions are called.
